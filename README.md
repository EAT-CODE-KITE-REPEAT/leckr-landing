# leckr-landing

LECKR Landing makes it possible to make landing pages very quickly to test a value proposition. 

## Goal
* Know projected Cost Per Install (CPI)
* Know viral reach per install per retention attempt (VRPIPRA)
* Know purchase ratio (CPP)
* Easily A/B test multiple sites
* Optimize to combination of those (modeled out over time and money)
* Test new ideas within a day
* Get feedback before making an app

This is the real µ-Cycle, the hyper sprint to pre-validate ideas super quickly.
After an idea pre-validates, your promise is good enough and you can build a PoC that delivers.
Then, of course, it's still the question wether or not people will actually use it. 
Also, it's a question wether or not people will pay, but you can even test this before making the app!

## Ideal flow of new ideas
Instead of making a new app every time and work 6 months before converting anything, the flow should be more like this:

1) Buy a domain
2) DNS to Surge
3) Define value propositions
3) Create assets for the landing page and FB ads for a few value propositions I want to A/B test. As many as I like. 
4) Create new leckr-landing object and deploy everything
5) Improve the site a bit if necessary (probably not)
6) Post a story on show-hn, indie-hackers, medium, producthunt, etc. Learn from feedback and see how it converts. If feedback is positive and reach is big, continue. Otherwise, go back to 3, or, if nobody wants it at all: quit.
7) Create an Ad on Facebook or Google or even a general App platform like Adjust, that leads to the landing page. Measure everything (CPI, CPP, VRPIPRA).
8) Catch converting pixels, create lookalike audience and target Ad on them. 
9) Measure everything again. Estimate projection of CLV. These stats now are good projectsions of when the app is real. 
10) Model this on time and costs, and see if it's worth a shot.

Of course, you should deliver on the value propositions, so keep it simple. If you do deliver, then you can count on long-lasting users, and then CLV will be very high. It can be huge if people already are willing to pay without using the app. This should always be tried.

# Stages of B2C SaaS Startups

With leckr-landing, all strategies and software for execution of them will be thought out, from pre-validation to PoC. The landing page will change in all stages.

## Ideas & Conceptualization (±8h):
The most important step not to skip. Perfection may take up to a few days, but a first version can be made within ±4 hours.

Stage 1) Get ideas
Stage 2) Market research & discussion with friends
Stage 3) Extensive Lean Canvas (why, how, rough USP definition, virality estimation, marketing estimation, business model, critical mass, chicken and egg estimation, estimated money needed to be viable, sales needed estimation)

Goal: Figure out if it's probably viable

## Prototype & Pre-validation (±16h and $±1000,-)
If the concept doesn't feel good, quit. If the concept feels and looks good on paper, it's time to prototype & pre-validate. Before making the app, it's important to get some feedback.

Stage 1) Create assets (#4)
Stage 2) Ad -> Simple form -> follow up form (#2)
Stage 3) Ad -> Basic landing page -> Email -> Form -> Follow up form (#1)
Stage 4) ProductHunt announcement, Reddit, Show HN, Forums, Friends
Stage 5) Evaluation
Evaluate KPI's and feedback, send this to advisors & potential investors.

Goal: at least 100 filled in forms.

## PoC & Validation (±80h)
If the ads conversions and form-feedback are promising, continue. Otherwise, go back to the ideas stage, or give up. Now it's time to really spend some time.

Stage 1) Build & test the app myself
Stage 2) Get 4 testers from early adopters that have the right devices (Old & New, iPhone & Android)
Stage 3) Iterate over feedback
Stage 4) Email all early adopters to invite for the BETA
Stage 5) Iterate over feedback again
Stage 6) Measure KPI's (especially retention and virality), possibly by sending a few surveys (for money) or doing this manually

Goal: Lots of feedback and good KPI indication to decide to continue and in which direction

## MVP & PMF (±160h and $±10k for Ads)
If users keep using it and it still looks promising, it's time to really make a monetizable product out of this, and invest at least the same $ as your time is worth on advertising to get a little userbase going. 

Stage 1) Define & Build product into a monetizable thing, ready for growth, analytics & virality
Stage 2) Open up the landing page, improve it, continue with ads (#1)
Stage 3) Tweak funnels, try to earn money back
Stage 4) Estimate KPI's, make them promising

Goal: Earn money back as fast as possible, or quit if you figure out you won't

## FiF & Seed (±80h)
At this point, you're either deciding to bootstrap or raise money, based on circumstances. Of course, this step can be skipped if you plan to bootstrap for sure. This step almost always overlaps with the previous one.

Stage 1) Show KPI's to potential investors (can also be the crowd)
Stage 2) Talk to many investors
Stage 3) Go with the best deal, or not.

Goal: Get some funding for a bit of equity to be able to grow much faster.

## Grow (±∞)
Now, tweaking growth should be the main goal. There are many KPI's for this. Some very interesting ones are the Viral Factor, TTEYMB (Time to earn your money back), and the more famous CAC:CLV ratio. Also, userbase churn should not be forgotten. 



Total time estimation: 344 hours + ∞. That's 3.5 months for Dunbar, but 1,5 month's already done. So it can be done by the end of june, more or less. However, I have no focus.... :(
