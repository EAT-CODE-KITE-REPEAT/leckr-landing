# leckr-landing

LECKR Landing makes it possible to make landing pages very quickly to test a value proposition. 

## Goal
* Know projected Cost Per Install (CPI)
* Know viral reach per install per retention attempt (VRPIPRA)
* Know purchase ratio (CPP)
* Easily A/B test multiple sites
* Optimize to combination of those (modeled out over time and money)
* Test new ideas within a day
* Get feedback before making an app

This is the real Âµ-Cycle, the hyper sprint to pre-validate ideas super quickly.
After an idea pre-validates, your promise is good enough and you can build a PoC that delivers.
Then, of course, it's still the question wether or not people will actually use it. 
Also, it's a question wether or not people will pay, but you can even test this before making the app!

## Ideal flow of new ideas
Instead of making a new app every time and work 6 months before converting anything, the flow should be more like this:

1) Buy a domain
2) DNS to Surge
3) Define value propositions
3) Create assets for the landing page and FB ads for a few value propositions I want to A/B test. As many as I like. 
4) Create new leckr-landing object and deploy everything
5) Improve the site a bit if necessary (probably not)
6) Post a story on show-hn, indie-hackers, medium, producthunt, etc. Learn from feedback and see how it converts. If feedback is positive and reach is big, continue. Otherwise, go back to 3, or, if nobody wants it at all: quit.
7) Create an Ad on Facebook or Google or even a general App platform like Adjust, that leads to the landing page. Measure everything (CPI, CPP, VRPIPRA).
8) Catch converting pixels, create lookalike audience and target Ad on them. 
9) Measure everything again. Estimate projection of CLV. These stats now are good projectsions of when the app is real. 
10) Model this on time and costs, and see if it's worth a shot.

Of course, you should deliver on the value propositions, so keep it simple. If you do deliver, then you can count on long-lasting users, and then CLV will be very high. It can be huge if people already are willing to pay without using the app. This should always be tried.
