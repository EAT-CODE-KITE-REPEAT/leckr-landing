## Feedback

Getting feedback isn't that easy. I shouldn't ask it by whatsapp or mail. I should really plan a face to face session in which I let someone see the site for the first time and ask them for their first honest impression. Since I got 10+ websites

- [ ] Plan some feedback sessions in the park, for dinner, or for lunch.
