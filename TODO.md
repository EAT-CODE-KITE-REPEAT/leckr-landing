### New sections `#toplan`

- [ ] Story Section
- [ ] Features section (Copy OVFiets)
- [ ] Improve Blogs Section
- [ ] Team Section

### Copy

- [ ] Get copy from [beta blog](https://karsens.com/dunbar-beta) (and Typeform), put it in different landing pages.

### Cleanup

- [ ] better naming for communify-specific components and pages like `CommunityDirectory` instead of `Directory` and `communifyUnsubscribe` instead of `unsubscribe`


### Landing page online with A/B (2h)

- [ ] See if it's possible to A/B test with top-level domain.
- [ ] How to change landing page for different origins? For example, if you have ?ref=fb|tnw|phia

### Email collection

- [ ] Collect email on MastHead in order to download app. If this flag is true, remove iOS and Android buttons, just show form to fill in e-mail.
- [ ] Set up third-party backend for this, like mailchimp.
- [ ] Make it work, make it automatically send an email with some data, when we receive form-submission

### Share section

This Share Section should be able to make an estimation of virality of the app.

- [ ] Share button to share on WhatsApp (or in other places)
- [ ] Measure clicks on this
- [ ] Create nice short links that still can be tracked
- [ ] Measure clicks on links in whatsapp messages
