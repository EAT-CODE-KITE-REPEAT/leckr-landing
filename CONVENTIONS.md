# Conventions

- Use yarn
- https://medium.com/@claire.ristow/how-to-test-your-localhost-on-an-iphone-54e7b11439b7 to test on iphone
- by default, always test on iPhone too because somehow there are a lot different rules there! Especially maybe because it's an older iPhone. Therefore, also DON'T UPGRADE to a newer iOS, if possible.

- change title in index.html
- settings/index.js imports project js.
- settings/\_variables.scss imports project scss.
- of course, add all you want in the project settings js file
