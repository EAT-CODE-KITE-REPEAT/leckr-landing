Taal:
- Tot augustus is er nog een beta. Voor die beta is 80% Nederlands. Ook zal ik meer hebben aan Nederlanders die wat ouder zijn, dat kunnen namelijk goed inversteerders worden. Voor deze mensen, die wat minder goed engels kunnen, is een nederlanse site belangrijk. Voor iedereen weegt het wel mee. Sowieso is het inbouwen van meerdere talen wel slim.

Implementatie taal belangrijk:
- In de section zelf moeten het gewoon allemaal props zijn waarbij de juiste taal al gezet is, en de juiste reference (voor audience personalisation).
- In de settings file (deze) moet het heel simpel te zien zijn. talen moeten het dichtst bij de tekst staan. De overliggende structuur is verder daarbuiten. 
- Alle string options in 



Voor broad audience is het te inprersonal.

Je wil juist mensen zien. maar voor entrepreneurial audience is het wel ok


## Support all browsers

Galaxy S6 has stock Android browser by default, which doesn't support the current setup. A white screen appears.
This probably has to do with newer React 16.8 while not using babel. Communify.cc and OVFiets.net still work fine.

https://reactjs.org/docs/javascript-environment-requirements.html

https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/supported-browsers-features

Weirdly enough, the default browserl.ist says only 90% global is supported. But maybe it's because that exlcludes a lot of smaller devices.

Options are

1. Downgrade to lower react again, use packages same as in communify's script. Problem: no type support.

2. Use babel and see if that works.

3. Try to setup clean react project using babel and all recommended polyfills so it works on all old browsers too.

However, it's not that important. There aren't that many old browsers under the early adopters. This has to be done before the #launch, so before August. Let's wait for SDK33 and see if we can convert to RN Web.

# Mission

The mission of Dunbar is to create higher quality and more meaningful interactions between people to make them more brilliant, wise, self-reliant, and succesful. To reverse [human downgrading](https://www.wired.com/story/tristan-harris-tech-is-downgrading-humans-time-to-fight-back/) of communication, social systems and relationships.

# My Story

When I was eleven years old, I learned how to make websites. When I was twelve I created a mafia game (For a similar example, see [Omerta](https://barafranca.com/)). Creating this game, and playing other games myself, took most of my free time. I was hooked. Addicted. Hard to separate from my computer. It was an amazing experience to create and maintain a mafia game for a couple hundred daily active users for over ten years, but it was also very stressfull at times, and the ethic side doubtful. One the one hand, I had created a wonderful playground for young kids to compete, learn and socialize online. At first, this made me very happy. But then I discovered the dark side. Some kids were burning their parents money and others were playing over 8 hours a day on average. This made me very unhappy, but I couldn't just pull the plug. This made me depressed for a while. I quit a few years later.

Twelve years after I learned how to make websites, after finishing my bachelors in Artificial Intelligence, I traveled the world for 6 months. Weeks went without screens.. It made me less of a nerd, way more social, and also incredibly happy. What did I really want? After traveling, I decided I wanted to make an app that bring people together. Away from their screens. Because this had made ME so much happier too.

For about six months, I burned through all my money while working full time on my first attempt: [Communify](https://communify.cc). In hindsight, many things went wrong. It was over developed, complex and had no good business model. What was even worse, is that it took away some of the business of the clients I was hoping to sell it to: the Coworking Space. The Coworkers loved the idea, but the coworking space hated it. Too bad. I had failed. As a result, I had an existential crisis that lasted two months. 

About 10 months after failing and one regular office job later, I decided to move to Amsterdam, learn more about startups, and try again. I love the vibe in the startup scene. I learned a lot really quickly. Even had two startup jobs at the same time. Read almost a dozen of books about startups. Also, I've read [Deep Work](http://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/), [Digital Minimalism](http://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) and became very much inspired by [Humane Tech](https://humanetech.com/). Also, I read a lot about relationships ([Robin Dunbar](https://www.amazon.com/Many-Friends-Does-Person-Need/dp/0674057163), [Catherine Price](https://phonebreakup.com/), [Susan Pinker](https://www.susanpinker.com/the-village-effect/), and more). These books have all inspired me so much, I came up with the next attempt...

This time I came up with Dunbar. A completely different approach for the same goal: bringing people together. When entering a new environment, it can be a challenge to make friends, and certainly the right ones, and meaningful ones. Also, I noticed that I had made hundreds of 'friends' in my life, but had very few active ones. Most of my friendships were very low-level. 

Professionally, it was hard to remember all professional connections I made in a short time. It all become a lot, really quickly. Email. Slack Channels. Whatsapp. LinkedIn. My professional contacts are everywhere, except where I really want them: On events, so we can actually talk IRL. Consequently, I made dozens of new connections in a couple of months but it didn't have a big impact because they were all very low-level connections. The ones I wanted to keep in touch with, got burried under hunreds of other connections on LinkedIn, or below hundreds of e-mails. Why is this so hard!?

In March of this year I started working on Dunbar. It's my best attempt on solving all these problems (and even a few more).

**Some things that will help to make it convert better:** 

* **Invitation Code** Club users get a code to invite a friend that can join Club for free. That person, in turn, gets a code as well. Loyal Club Members get a new invitation-code to give away every 6 months. If this code is used, the club user gets a code that gives away club membership for 50% off.

* **Multiple codes per pro user** Pro users get 6 codes that will remain usable as long as they pay their memberships fee every month. This means the Dunbar app can be activated on 6 devices. If the user has less than so many devices, the user can give away those codes to friends. This will generate word of mouth.

* **Invite Action** Additionally, sometimes there will be an invite action (by email). All pro users get a link that gives 50% sale on the pro membership to friends.

**Some additional ways to market**

* **Dunbar for Business** will be sold to businesses in a B2C2B way once there is traction. Dunbar for Business will cost around â¬10/employee/month, and will have huge impact on employee mental health.

* **Dunbar for Events** Do you want all your **event or conference** participants inside the Dunbar app? This is going to be a possibility too. [Get in touch](/contact)

* **Dunbar For Coworking** makes it possible for all coworkers to find eachother and connect [Get in touch](/contact)

* [Donate (PayPal)](https://paypal.me/communify?locale.x=nl_NL)

### Longer story (Â±40 words)
When people aren't convinced by two screenshots and a headline, a longer story will appear on the landing page when scrolling down. 

* Social Networks minimize real life interaction to maximize screentime, and sparisify and degrade your relations. Dunbar helps you to keep the more meaningful ones, and make them better.

* Dunbars Limit (150) is the limit of maintainable stable relationships. Most people have more, but very sparsified relationships. Spending less time on each relationship makes them less valuable. Dunbar helps you get less but more worthwhile connections. 

* Dunbar lets you assign your network into 3 categories: The inner circle, friends, and the outer circle. Also, you can analyze your relational activity so you can see where to improve.

* According to Dunbar, the limit of active stable relationships is 150. Managing and limiting your active relationships to 150 people is an enormous task. With Dunbar, we help you to organize, analyze and improve your personal and professional relationships.

* I care about my friends, but FB, other Social Media, and contact apps make it hard to really maintain my relationships. I want to decide who I care about, and not let the algorithms decide who I get information about (e.g. on the FB Timeline). I want to do more meaningful activities with my friends, rather than using flat communication platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and SnapChat. I want fewer, but stronger friendships.

* Internet connects the unconnected, but disconnects the connected. Our app tries to approach [The Village Effect](https://www.amazon.de/Village-Effect-Face-Face-Healthier/dp/0307359549) in cities.

* **No Machine Learning, but Personal Choice.** Content of your network/contacts at Dunbar isn't driven by a screentime-optimized machine learning model like on Facebook and other Social Media. On Dunbar, it also isn't driven by the amount of content your network post about themselves. On Dunbar, you are in control of your relationships, and you decide who you want to keep in touch with. How often? Why? How? You can create your own, personal, private overview, and this will greatly benefit your relationships in the long term.
