# Hire LECKR

Currently, LECKR is just me, Wijnand. I'm available for short projects or consulting. My hourly rate is ‚Ç¨85,- an hour.

When we initiate a collaboration, I'm **fully commited to your project and its success for the time I work for it**. Together with my agile working habits and strong opinion of keeping implementation simple and elegant, development of the app will be at least **[2-5x faster](https://blog.karsens.com/i-just-made-an-app-in-26-hours/)**.
