/**
 * #TODO NOW
 * - approach blurpers with this website and a beer --> add blurps
 * - finish github integration libraries (see paper)
 * - approach network with this website and a beer
 * - get SEO right, ask David for advice
 * - try undraw.co image of surfing + a mobile phone (phtoshoped)
 * - put my personal picture at advise page
 * Mailchimp:
 * - set up default mails with content for every interested thing. Send them one extra email 4x a year or so with new blogs (if possible)
 * - find and approach as many react / react native companies as possible.
 *
 *
 * Why (company goal): High-quality apps in no-time
 *
 * Who (target audience):
 * - Profitable websites run by companies that are thinking about it (#1 target audience)
 * - People that already use react native succesfully and need handy libraries
 * - Profitable companies that don't do so well on the react native part and need a hand to get their codebase under control
 *
 * How
 * - organic search leading to blogs that I cross posted on my site, on medium, and all kinds of other channels
 * - and cold mail / calling
 *
 *
 * How to sell it?
 *
 * - make clear why it's a great choice
 * - make clear how much it would normally cost to get started
 * - make clear how much of a favor I'm doing them (how much cheaper it is)
 * - for exact pricing, get in touch
 *
 *
 *
 * Products
 * - make all GitHub pages look professional
 * - post blog about all libraries
 * - make a video for every library
 * - make product type definition
 * - make product overview section (picture + one sentence pitch)
 * - make product details section landing page with pricing open source + premium model https://www.mysql.com/products/
 * - add integration with mollie and ask rediculous amounts (monthly or one-time-fee)

# Free Advice

Currently, LECKR is just me, Wijnand. I give **free advice** sessions about React Native, Expo and use of Open Source Libraries. Here we can see if LECKR could be a **good fit** for you. 

Also, I'm available for short projects or further consulting.

When we initiate a collaboration, I'm fully commited to your project and its success for the time I work for it. 

My **expertise** and strongest points:

- Productivity & workflow optimization
- Agile & Lean
- Strong opinion of keeping implementation simple and elegant
- Boilerplate reduction through simplicity and open source
- Reduction of technical debt through automated documenation generation
- Startup Strategy, Conceptualization and Validation
- Migration to React Native & Expo

In 2019 I decided to track my own KPI's and my startups KPI's, and share them publicly on this page. I will do that on a monthly basis. [Here are the KPI's I defined](https://github.com/EAT-CODE-KITE-REPEAT/communify-open/issues/74)

Other personal KPI's I wish to track are exersize, CO2 footprint, and waste footprint. Since I don't know yet how to accurately do this, I don't do this yet. Ideas are welcome.
